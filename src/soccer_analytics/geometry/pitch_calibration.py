"""Calibrate a PTZ camera against the pitch from landmark clicks, then map any pixel of any frame to pitch metres.

Model
-----
World (pitch) frame: X along the touchline, Y across the pitch, Z up, metres. The camera sits at ``position`` (Z =
height above the pitch) and never translates. Frame ``t`` has orientation ``R_t = R_base @ Q_t`` (``Q_t`` from
``camera_motion`` maps frame-t rays to the reference frame's rays) and focal length ``f_t = f_ref * (chain zoom)``.

A pixel ``(u, v)`` of frame ``t`` is the world ray ``d = R_t K_t^-1 [u, v, 1]``; it meets the ground ``Z = 0`` at
``position + s d`` with ``s = -position_z / d_z`` for rays that point downward. Unlike a planar reference image this
is exact at *every* orientation, which matters because the camera pans ~90 degrees across a match.

Unknowns: camera position (3), base orientation (3 axis-angle), focal scale (1)  -> 7 parameters. Each landmark
(known pitch XY, clicked pixel in some frame) gives 2 equations, so 4+ landmarks spread over the pitch suffice.
