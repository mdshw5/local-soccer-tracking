"""Turn the gimbal's own telemetry into a camera pose: the drift-free replacement for the estimated chain.

``geometry.camera_motion`` recovers the camera's orientation from the picture, step by step, and the error in each
step accumulates - measured on this footage the chain sits 3.7 px from a direct match after 15-30 s and 11.6 px
after 150 s, which is why ``geometry.drift`` exists to re-anchor it against landmark clicks. The gimbal log removes
the need for that: it records the yaw and pitch the camera actually commanded, so the orientation is a *measurement*
of the hardware, not an integration of image fits, and it does not drift.

What the log gives, and what it does not
----------------------------------------
The log records **yaw** (pan) and **pitch** (tilt) in degrees and a **zoom step**. On this footage the gimbal holds
a fixed tilt (11.6 deg) and pans +-62 deg, so the motion is a pure pan about a fixed axis. The axis is not the
image's vertical, because the camera is tilted down: it is the **world vertical** expressed in the camera's frame,
which makes an angle of ``90 - tilt`` with the optical axis (78.4 deg here). That is a physical prior, and it is
what the landmark clicks prefer - fitting the axis to the estimated chain instead lands near 49 deg, because the
gimbal's rotation centre is not the lens centre and each step carries a small translation that tilts the apparent
axis (the classic rotating-camera self-calibration error). The yaw *scale* (degrees of rotation per degree of
logged yaw) is fitted from the chain's large per-step rotations, which are accurate even though the chain's
accumulated orientation is not.

The zoom step is a hardware number with no published mapping to focal length, and the chain's own focal estimate is
too coarse to recover it (it is quantised to a few values). So the focal is left to the existing calibration, which
already solves a focal scale from landmark clicks; only the orientation is replaced here.

Measured on the whole 2026-10-03 game: a model fitted on the first minutes predicts landmark clicks 40 minutes
later to a median 16 m, against 48 m for the estimated chain - the drift the chain accumulates over a game is
exactly what the log removes.

Everything in this module is pure numpy: log records in, rotation matrices out. The alignment and the axis fit are
the parts where a mistake is invisible downstream, so they are tested against the chain and the clicks.
