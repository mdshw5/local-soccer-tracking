"""Automatic pitch-line observations: the re-anchoring the clicks cannot provide.

The landmark clicks are exact ground control, but there are only eight of them, at two moments nine minutes
apart - so the drift correction between and after them is pure interpolation, and the chain's focal (searched
per step, pinned near the default for every zoom step the operator made) is only ever pinned at two zoom levels.
The pitch markings themselves are the answer: they are visible in almost every frame, they are the same ground
truth the clicks encode, and a line crossing can be found automatically.

What a line gives, and what it does not
---------------------------------------
A detected line crossing says "this marking passes through this pixel, running this way" - one number, the
offset *across* the line. It cannot say which point *along* the line the pixel is, so the observation is
direction-constrained: the residual is the perpendicular offset only. That is strictly weaker than a click
(two numbers) but it is available at dozens of frames instead of two, which is exactly what the drift fit
needs: more knots, spread over the game, each pinning the pointing and the focal where the pitch is actually
seen rather than interpolated.

The detection is deliberately conservative, because a wrong observation is worse than a missing one - a knot
fitted to a misdetected line can absorb almost any error. A candidate is kept only when a white stroke
(brightness well above the local pitch) sits within a few pixels of the predicted line, running the predicted
way, with enough contrast to be a marking and not a shadow edge or a player's sock. Frames where the camera
is panning fast are skipped: motion blur smears the strokes and the prediction itself is least trustworthy
exactly when the pan is fastest.
