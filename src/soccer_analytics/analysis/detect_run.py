"""Run the event detectors against everything a match has on disk.

The detectors themselves are pure (``event_detection.detect_events``); this module is the wiring that loads a
match's artefacts - the replay payload's player tracks, the ball scan's positions projected through the segment's
camera chain, the pitch calibration, the recorded whistles and the shirt numbers - and reconciles the result into
the match's event log.

Both the dashboard's own "Detect events" button and the background ``scripts/run_detections.py`` go through here,
so a candidate found from the page and one found by the background pass cannot disagree about times, teams or
which rows are replaced.

``MissingInput`` carries a human-readable reason the detectors cannot run yet; callers show it - as a warning
under the button, or as the run's error status - rather than letting a bare exception out.
