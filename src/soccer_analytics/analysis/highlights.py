"""Highlight reels: pick the moments, then cut them out of the source with ffmpeg.

Three tiers, mirroring what the product describes:
* ``clip``   - 15-30 s single moments, for sharing;
* ``goals``  - 1-2 min of scoring plays (from manual tags, since no goal event is inferred);
* ``match``  - a ~5 min summary spread across the whole match.

Moment ranking is explicit and inspectable: manual tags outrank audio candidates, and momentum swings add weight, so
a coach can see why a clip was chosen instead of being handed a black box.

    Unlike :func:`export_reel` this does not pad the clip to ``MIN_CLIP_S`` or join parts - it is the raw window the
    moment describes, scaled down so it loads and seeks quickly in the browser. When the moment carries its own
    video (every detected candidate does), that file is the one cut from; ``source`` is only the fallback for tags
    and momentum moments, which belong to whatever the page has selected.

    ``clip_offsets`` maps a recording's path to where it starts inside ``source``, for the same reason as
    :func:`export_reel`.

    ``mode`` is one of :data:`PREVIEW_SETTINGS` and is the whole cost trade: ``"audio"`` writes an MP3 of the
    window (no video decode at all), ``"quick"`` a low-rate flipbook of the camera's own keyframes, ``"full"`` the
    size a shared clip wants. ``width`` overrides the mode's width where a caller has its own idea - the tests use a
    tiny one.
