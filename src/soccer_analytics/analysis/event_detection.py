"""Infer match events from the ball scan and the player tracks.

The whistle scan (``analysis.events``) finds stoppages; the ball scan (``analysis.ball``) follows the ball. This
module is where the two, plus the player tracks from Stage B, are read together to say *what happened*: a penalty
awarded, a goal scored, a corner won, a shot that did not go in, a clearance, a tackle.

Everything here is pure - arrays and tracks in, events out - so the logic is unit-tested against the simulated
match, where the ball's true path is known, rather than against a video file. The detectors are deliberately
conservative and every one of them says in its note what it saw, because a wrong event on the timeline is worse
than a missing one: the whole point of the last stretch of work was that a measurement of nothing poisons
everything downstream.

What each detector keys on, and why:

* **goal** - the ball reaches a goal mouth moving toward the line, and within a short window afterwards the ball is
  static near the center spot. The reset is what separates a goal from a shot that hit the side netting: the ball
  is put back on the center spot only after a goal.
* **shot** - the ball is kicked hard toward a goal from within range and does *not* produce a goal reset. A shot on
  target that the keeper saves and a shot wide look the same to a ball track, so both are reported as a shot and
  the note says where it was aimed.
* **corner** - the ball is static near a corner flag and is then kicked, or the ball appears (a fresh detection)
  entering from a corner. The static-then-kick form is the common one; the appearance form catches a corner the
  scan only picks up once it is in flight.
* **penalty** - a whistle, then the ball static at the penalty spot for a moment, then a hard kick. The whistle is
  what makes it a penalty rather than a free kick from a similar spot; without a whistle the same geometry is
  reported as a shot.
* **clearance** - the ball is in a team's own defensive third and is kicked hard *away* from the goal that team is
  defending. Which goal that is comes from the per-half orientation below.
* **tackle** - a player who was moving comes to a near stop right beside the ball while the ball's own velocity
  changes. This is a *motion* proxy, not pose: the footage has no skeleton, so "went to ground" cannot be seen
  directly and the note says the event is a challenge inferred from movement, not a confirmed tackle.

The per-half orientation (which end each team defends, and so which way it attacks) is derived from where each
team's players spend the half: a team defends the goal its players are nearer to. It is what lets a clearance be
told from a shot - the same fast kick is one or the other depending on which goal it is heading away from.

    ``start_s`` is the analyzed window's own start offset in the source video - the kick-off offset chosen in Step 1.

# a ball being passed reads 1-3 m/s and a shot 15-30 m/s. The gates sit in the gaps between those.
#
# The measurement is deliberately *not* a per-frame difference. Measured on the real whole-game scan, a per-frame
# difference of the projected positions has a p90 of 57 m/s and a maximum of 96,000 m/s: the projection amplifies a
# pixel of jitter into meters when the ball is far away or near the horizon, and a single bad frame then reads as a
# 200 m/s kick. Three things fix it, and each was measured rather than guessed:
#
# * positions off the pitch are dropped - the projection of a ball near the horizon lands kilometers away, and 18%
#   of the real scan's finite positions are outside the pitch by more than 3 m;
# * a position far from its neighbors' median is dropped as a spike (589 more frames on the real scan);
# * the speed is the *net displacement over a short window*, not a per-frame step, and it is paired with a
#   straightness ratio (net displacement / path length). Jitter is fast but not straight; a kicked ball is both.
#
# The window is causal - it looks back only - so a kick is not smeared across the frames before it. With those, the
# real scan's speeds sit at a p50 of 2.4 m/s and a p90 of 15 m/s, and the physically impossible readings are gone.
