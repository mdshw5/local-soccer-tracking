"""Match events: what the audio can tell us, and what only a human can.

The whistle is the one match event that is reliably detectable from this footage. It is a narrowband tone, so it is
found by tracking how much a single frequency bin stands out from its neighbourhood in the 2-4.5 kHz band over time,
rather than by loudness - on the real sample the whole match is dominated by speech near the microphone, and a
loudness threshold flagged nothing at all.

Everything else is a manual tag. The ball has its own dedicated scan (``analysis.ball``), but no event is inferred
from it yet, so goals, shots, saves and blocks stay human calls, and the report says so rather than inventing them.
Audio-derived moments are therefore *candidates for review*, presented to the user as such.

# away - the same blast can differ by 30x on distance alone. A stricter gate would drop exactly the far-half

# harmonics of the speaker's pitch (100-300 Hz) and their formants, all well below the whistle band - while a
# whistle is a lone tone with almost nothing down there. Measured on synthesised shouts (f0 120/190/300 Hz, formants
# in the band) that all cleared the prominence gate: 53-67% of their energy sat below 1.2 kHz, against 0% for a pure
# tone. On the real footage the loudest blasts (up to 11000x the match level) measure 0.0-0.4, while the candidates
# that sound like yelling measure 0.7-0.9. So a candidate whose median energy share below the ceiling is at least

# How much a blast is allowed to lift the region *below* the whistle band, relative to the same region either side

#
# This is the gate a user's own labels produced (the first sixteen confirmed/rejected candidates, 2026-10-05). They
# named the two things that survive the loudness and voice gates: a female coach's shout and birds of prey. Both
# carry their own energy well below the whistle band - a shouted vowel keeps its lower harmonics and formants there
# however high the voice is, and a raptor's call is a rich, gliding tone rather than a lone whistle - while a
# referee's blast puts everything into its own narrow band and leaves the region below untouched.
#
# The measure is deliberately *differential*. The crowd's speech sits in that region constantly, so its absolute
# share says very little - a loud passage raises the whistle band and the voice band together, which is why the
# share gate let a female shout through. What separates a voice or a call from a whistle is whether the *blast
# itself* brought low frequencies with it, so the region is measured over the blast (with a tenth of a second of
# grace either side, so a very short blast is not judged on twenty frames) against the second either side of it.
#
# Measured with this definition on those labels: every *true* whistle stayed between 0.54x and 1.91x, and nine of
# the twelve false ones ran from 4.7x to 205x - a shout's or a call's own low energy rides in with it. The
# threshold sits in that wide gap rather than on the 1.9-2.0 knife edge two of the candidates sit on: the cost of
# keeping a candidate that turns out to be a call is one review click, and the cost of dropping a real whistle is
# a stoppage nobody ever sees. The three the gate does not catch are pure high tones with nothing below them, which
# is what a distant whistle on a neighbouring pitch also looks like: one microphone cannot tell those apart, and

        refining the detector could not shorten the queue it was meant to clean up. Now a row that no fresh
        candidate is anywhere near is dropped - unless a human *confirmed* it, because that verdict is data rather
        than a detector output, and losing it on a re-scan would make reviewing pointless. Manual tags are never
