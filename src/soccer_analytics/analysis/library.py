"""Match archive: everything computed for a match lives beside the footage it was computed from.

``data/matches`` in the repository was the first home for this, and it made an analysis a thing that only existed
on one machine. The archive now sits with the recording instead::

    <footage directory>/
        16-28-37.784.MP4          the original clips, untouched
        game_16-28-37.784.mp4     the combined game, also untouched (a stream copy of the clips)
        analysis/
            2026-10-03_game_16-28-37.784/        one directory per analyzed video, named by recording date + file
                match.json        this index (sources, segments, format, team names)
                events.json, report.json, replay.json, calibration.json, highlights/, identities/ ...
                segments/         the Stage A results (and the ball scan's) for this match's windows
                game.json         the game manifest and its marking proxy, when this video is a combined game

Copying that directory (or the whole footage directory) carries the analysis with it: the recorded paths are
stored relative to the analysis directory when they sit inside it, and re-pointed at load time, so a moved match
still opens its own footage and segments. The old ``data/matches`` root stays readable - archives that predate
this layout keep working until ``scripts/migrate_analysis.py`` moves them next to their videos.
