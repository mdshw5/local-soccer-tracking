"""Pitch-landmark clicking: where to click, and how a click on a zoomed crop maps back to the frame.

This is deliberately kept out of the Streamlit page. The coordinate maths is the part of landmark registration that
is easy to get subtly wrong (and impossible to unit-test inside a Streamlit script), so it lives here as pure
functions and the page only wires it to the component.

Three coordinate systems meet here, and mixing them up is silent rather than loud:

* **native pixels** - the frame as decoded, e.g. 3840x2160. `zoom_box` and the click crops work in these.
* **frame-normalised** - ``u = x / frame_width`` and ``v = y / frame_width``. Note ``v`` is divided by the *width*,
  not the height: that is the convention the camera model and the solver use, and it is not the same as the fraction
  of the frame you see on screen.
* **canvas pixels** - what the browser component reports, after the crop has been shrunk to at most `CLICK_MAX_WIDTH`.
  `canvas_scale` converts between these and native pixels, in both directions, so a click lands where it was made.

The zoom sliders take a fraction of the frame *width* and *height* respectively, because that is what a user reads
off the picture in front of them.

    The rest are the markings that are *usually* visible and add spread where the corners cannot: the penalty
    spots, and the four cardinals of the centre circle. They are the same standard markings for every format, so

    Two clicks of one landmark on *one* picture claim two pitch positions for a single image point, so at most one
    can be right - and the newest click is the user's latest word on where the marking is. A re-click to fix a slip
    and a re-label that collides with an older click both mean exactly that: replace the old one. Resolving the
    contradiction here, automatically, is what keeps a stray click from blocking the fit - refusing to fit until
    the user finds and removes it reads as the app rejecting perfectly good work.

    Clicks on *different* frames are not duplicates (that is the drift-anchoring workflow), and an untagged click
    cannot contradict anything - callers simply do not list those, and this function only groups exact
    ``(frame, landmark)`` matches. The newest is the highest ``pid``: pids are handed out in click order.
