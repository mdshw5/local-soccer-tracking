"""The annotated match stream: every frame of the analysed window, drawn with what the pipeline knows.

This is the moving-picture sibling of the pitch replay. Where that view draws measured pitch positions on a
diagram, this one serves the footage itself as MJPEG - each frame carries:

* the **pitch model**, projected back into the picture through the calibration's corrected camera chain (the
  touchlines, the halfway line, both boxes, the circles and the spots) - the same overlay the calibration view
  uses to show a fit against the real markings, per frame;
* the **detection boxes** of every field player the tracker follows, in that player's measured team colour;
* the **ball**, from the segment's ball scan, drawn as a detection when a detector saw it and as a hollow
  forecast ring when the scan coasted across a miss - the scan's own honesty rule, kept through to the player;
* a **label chip** on each player - the shirt number the roster or the OCR scan assigned, or the track id when
  nobody has named them - so an appearance in the footage can be matched to their row in the dashboard tables.

What it deliberately does not do is invent: a player without a number shows their track id, not a guess; a
forecast ball position is drawn differently from a sighting; and a replay that predates the per-player boxes is
refused with the one command that rebuilds it, rather than streaming boxes that would be silently absent.

The HTTP surface lives in :class:`MatchStreamServer` (index page, ``/matches``, ``/stream/<id>.mjpg`` and a
single-frame ``/frame/<id>.jpg``); ``scripts/run_match_stream.py`` is the process that runs it. Each viewer gets
their own ffmpeg decode, so streams can start at different times and speeds.
