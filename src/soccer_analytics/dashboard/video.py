"""H.264 annotated match video: the same overlays as the MJPEG stream, at the source's own frame rate.

The MJPEG endpoint pushes one JPEG per *analysis* frame - five a second - which is honest for a live overlay
but leaves the source's detail (and its 60 fps) on the table. This module drives the same renderer at whatever
rate the caller asks for, interpolating between analysis samples (``AnnotatedMatch.render_at``), and hands the
frames to an H.264 encoder over a pipe:

* :func:`encode_clip` - a bounded window encoded into an MP4 with its index at the front, so a player can seek
  it (the server caches these and serves them with range requests);
* :func:`iter_live_chunks` - the endless variant: a fragmented MP4 streamed out as the frames are made, paced
  to real time, which browsers play from a plain ``<video>`` (no MSE, no HLS).

What the box can *sustain* is the caller's to know: this machine decodes full 4K at ~28 fps, so a live 4K60
stream cannot keep up, while a bounded 4K clip simply takes longer to encode. NVENC is preferred, x264 is the
fallback; the frames never touch disk - only a finished clip does.

    a clip gets the index at the front instead (``faststart``), which is what makes it seekable, and a slower,
    denser tune. The keyframe interval doubles as the fragment interval for a live stream: about a second of
    video per fragment is what keeps a viewer near the live edge without chopping the stream into confetti.

    ``rate`` is the *content* speed: the muxer's clock runs ``fps * rate`` per source second, so a 2x request
    plays twice as fast in any player - the audio, when asked for, is retimed to match (``atempo``), and the
    writer paces to the same product. ``source``/``audio`` add the match's own soundtrack from the recording,
    seek-together with the video window; ``1:a:0?`` keeps a source without an audio track working, and the
    output is bounded by ``-t`` (the window over the rate) rather than ``-shortest``: a soundtrack shorter than
    the video must not truncate the clip, and one longer must not extend a live stream past its window in a
    silent tail.

    ``audio_inputs`` is for a never-merged game, whose window may cross a clip join: one ``(path, local_start,
    local_duration)`` per clip the window touches, each an ordinary seek inside its own clip. One piece maps
    like the single source; several are stitched by ffmpeg's ``concat`` filter (video is piped, so only the
