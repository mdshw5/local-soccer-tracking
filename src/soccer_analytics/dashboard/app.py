"""Dashboard for the gimbal-camera (single following camera) match analysis.

Workflow, in the order it appears on screen:

1. **Choose footage** - pick or browse to a video, optionally start part-way in, and run the heavy per-segment pass
   (Stage A) in the background with a progress bar and resume.
2. **Register the pitch** - click landmarks in a reference frame; the camera's motion is already known, so this
   calibrates position and orientation and reports how well it fits, per landmark.
3. **Build the report** - cheap and re-runnable: pitch-space tracking, teams, distances, momentum, and the
   separately-scanned ball track when one has run. One press of "Build report + run all detections" also starts
   the ball, whistle and shirt-number scans in the background, infers the detectable events and rebuilds the
   replay with everything the scans found.
4. **Watch, tag and cut highlights** - the playback's own tag buttons stamp an event on the current second, and
   the review queue, the detectors' settings and the highlight reels sit directly under the pitch, so tagging
   happens while the game is on screen rather than in a section of its own further down the page.

Every number on the page is either measured or explicitly labelled as a guess or a manual tag. Where a metric is
beyond what the footage (and the scans built on it) can honestly support, the page says so rather than inventing one.

The camera moves, so the app has to work out *where the camera was* before it can say where a player is. It does
that from **landmarks**: fixed markings on the pitch whose real position you already know, because the laws of the
game put them there. Halfway line, centre spot, corner flags, the goalposts, the penalty spots, the centre
circle - those are the only things in the frame with a known real-world position, so the calibration is only ever
as good as these clicks.

**What to click**

| Landmark | Click exactly on |
| --- | --- |
"""
        + "\n".join(f"| `{name}` | {LANDMARK_HELP[name]} |" for name in land_table)
        + """

**How to do it**

1. Pick a frame where the pitch markings are visible - any frame works, because the camera's motion is already
   known. Use the timeline under the whole-frame view to scrub to one, or press **Play** and pause where the
   markings are clearest.
2. **Aim the magnified view from the whole-frame view.** Click a point on the whole frame and the magnified view
   moves so that point is in the middle, reloading at whatever frame the timeline is showing; **scroll** to zoom in
   or out on it. The yellow box shows what the magnified view covers, so it doubles as a check that you are looking
   at the right part of the pitch.
3. **Click the landmark on the magnified view.** A click opens the landmark list right where you clicked - pick
   which landmark it is and the click is committed at once; there is no Apply step. Zoom in far enough that
   the corner is unmistakable: at zoom 8 a screen pixel is a pixel of the 4K frame, whereas a full-frame view is
   worth roughly a metre of ground error per pixel on the far side of the pitch.
4. **If a corner is not in shot, use the goalposts instead.** The near corner flags are often out of frame or lost
   against the grass, but the posts are easy to pick out, and the base of a post - where it meets the goal line -
   says as much about that end of the pitch as the flag does. Click **goal post left-near** / **goal post
   left-far** (or the `right` pair) in place of a corner you cannot see. The posts are 7.32 m apart, so the two of
   them together also fix the goal line's direction.
5. **The penalty spots and centre circle are usually visible too.** The penalty spots and the four points where
   the centre circle crosses the halfway and centre lines are standard markings at a range of distances from the
   camera - exactly the spread the fit is short of when the near corners are out of shot. Click the ones you can
   see clearly. The boxes are deliberately not in the list: the six-yard box is small and lost against the
   netting, and an eighteen-yard corner is a bare junction of two lines with nothing to focus on - the posts carry
   that end of the pitch instead, and the penalty spots pin the box's depth.
6. **What you cannot substitute is spread.** Four clicks that are all a long way off, or all along one line, leave
   the fit with tens of metres of doubt - measured on a simulated match, four distant landmarks were out by more
   than 50 m. Aim for landmarks at a *range* of distances from the camera: the halfway line where it meets the near
   touchline is a good near one, because a long white line is easy to pick out. Click as many as you can be sure
   of. **Six to eight spread across the frame is comfortable; four is the absolute minimum.**
7. Repeat as needed. The app discards a bad click for you, and the fit check projects the corners you never
   clicked, so you can see where it thinks they are.

Once a calibration is saved, the whole-frame view carries it too: the pitch markings and every landmark, projected
through the fit onto whichever frame is loaded. To re-anchor a later moment, press **Place the calibrated landmarks
as markers** - each landmark the calibration used lands in the magnified view where the fit expects it, and you
**drag** it onto the real marking. A drag is a measurement, so it says how far the fit has slid by that moment; it
is also far quicker than finding five markings from scratch.

**The one thing that must be consistent:** label the corners in a loop around the pitch - one touchline, then the
other (this is the order in the dropdowns: `near-left`, `near-right`, then the two `far` ones). Get a consistent
loop and the app can work out the rest.

**Then check the yellow markings** the app draws back onto the frame. They are the whole pitch - touchlines, halfway
line, both boxes, the centre circle, the penalty arcs and spots and the corner arcs - projected through your
calibration. If they land on the real markings, the registration is good. If they are mirrored, or clearly in the
wrong place, fix the labels and recalibrate - the per-landmark error table tells you which click to look at.

Be honest with yourself about the far corners: at 40-90 m, four pixels of click noise is worth several metres of
ground error in the depth direction. If the far corner is a blurred smudge, leave it out and use the landmarks you
are sure of.
