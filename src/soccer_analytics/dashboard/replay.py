"""Build the animated pitch replay: the payload the pitch-view component fetches and draws.

Pure maths, no Streamlit. The dashboard saves the result beside the match (``replay.json``) and hands the component
a URL, so the tens of thousands of points are fetched once by the browser instead of being serialised onto the
Streamlit websocket on every rerun.

One entry per player holds their frame indices, pitch positions (metres) and speeds; upstream positions stay in
``PlayerTrack`` order, which is sorted by time - the component interpolates between consecutive observations.

Beside the players the payload carries the two *measurements* the view draws as they are: each team's measured kit
colour (what the clustering actually saw on the pitch) and the ball scan's track with its measured/forecast flag.

    ``team_colours`` is each team's measured kit colour as ``(r, g, b)``, ``None`` where the clustering could not
    separate the kits: the component paints its markers with the colour that was actually on the pitch, and keeps
    its own palette only as the fallback.

    ``camera_xy`` is the camera's own ground position (its X/Y, ignoring height). The replay draws a line from it
    to the aim point each frame, so the direction the camera is pointing is visible on the pitch. It is ``None``

    its goal ``side``), attached per track so the view can colour-code them; ``attack`` is the compact per-half
