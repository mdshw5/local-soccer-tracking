"""Event detection from the ball scan and the player tracks.

Built on hand-made ball tracks with known geometry rather than the simulated match, because the point of each test
is one detector's rule: a goal needs a centre-spot reset, a shot does not, a clearance needs to know which goal the
team defends. The simulated match is used only for the orientation, where the ground truth is the teams' own shape.
