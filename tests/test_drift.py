"""Drift correction: keeping a long video's projection on the markings, not just near the clicks.

The failure this exists for is measured, not hypothetical: the motion chain is accurate near the frames the user
clicked and slides metres off the markings by the end of a game. These tests build that situation on the simulated
match (a known per-step error accumulating along the chain), then check that fitting the smooth correction to
clicks spread over the video puts the projection back on the pitch - and that it never makes a good fit worse.
