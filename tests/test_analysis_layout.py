"""The analysis-beside-the-footage layout: derivation, discovery, portability and migration.

The point of the layout is that an analysis is *self-contained*: everything a match needs lives in one directory
next to the video, so the footage directory can be copied or moved as a unit. These tests pin the three
properties that make that true - where the directory is derived from, that recorded paths survive being moved,
and that the old repository-era data migrates into the same shape.
