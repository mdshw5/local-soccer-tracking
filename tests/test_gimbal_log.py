"""The gimbal log parser and the pan model built from it.

The parser is tested on synthetic log text that mirrors the real format (including the camera's habit of splitting
a line mid-token), and the pan model on a synthetic pan whose axis and scale are known - so a regression in either
is caught without the real footage.
