"""Rebuild one match's report and replay from its segment, headlessly.

The dashboard's "Build report" button runs exactly this pipeline; this script is the same work as its own process,
for the cases the button cannot serve: a rebuild after the analysis code changed (the artefacts on disk were
produced by an older build and no longer describe what the code does), a machine that runs headless, or a repair
after a stale Streamlit process wrote artefacts from out-of-date modules.

What it does, in the order the pipeline runs:

1. loads the segment and its saved calibration,
2. rebuilds the camera chain (``segment_poses`` - the gimbal log supplies the orientation where there is one),
3. projects the detections to the pitch, runs the tracker, the stitcher and the kit clustering (``build_report``),
4. rebuilds the replay payload - player boxes included, which is what the centred clips and any annotated view
   follow - and re-projects the segment's ball scan (``ball_track.json``) into it,
5. saves both beside the match (``report.json``, ``replay.json``) atomically.

The jersey scan is *not* rerun (it is easyocr over the whole segment - the dashboard starts it in the
background); when the track numbering changes the scan's suggestions stop matching, so rerun
``scripts/extract_jerseys.py`` yourself afterwards if the numbers matter.
